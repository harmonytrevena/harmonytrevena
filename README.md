Nice to meet you! I'm a Software Developer at DigitalCrafts currently based in Atlanta. Before venturing into the world of development, I worked as a project manager and interior designer. 

When I’m not working on my next project, you can find me outside enjoying nature or planning my next adventure, relocating back home (to Australia).
